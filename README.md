# Checkpoint-1
Design of an automatic allocation of people to their respective places.

##Allocation
The allocation program creates rooms and offices and automatically allocates people into them.
Every room has a maximum of 4 people assigned to it.
Every office has a maximum of 6 people assigned to it.

## Walkthough
Every person to be allocated is read from a txt file and a new instance , ```STAFF``` or ```FELLOW``` is created based on the who the ```Person``` is.
Every space is read from a txt file and a new space instance object is created based on the type of ```Space``` it is, ```OfficeSpace``` or ```LivingSpace```
People are allocated to spaces based on the occupant_type of the space, ```STAFF``` or ```FELLOW```, ```MALE``` or ```FEMALE```
